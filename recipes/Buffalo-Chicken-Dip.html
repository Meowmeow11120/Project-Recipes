    <h3> Ingredient</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong></li>
                <p>This Buffalo chicken dip starts with two 
                    cans of chunk chicken, making it extra easy 
                    and affordable. Of course, you can substitute rotisserie 
                    chicken or shredded chicken breasts if you'd prefer.</p>
            <li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong></li>
                <p>Make sure the cream cheese is 
                    softened for easy incorporation.</p>
            <li><strong>Ranch Dressing</strong></li>
                    <p>A cup of ranch dressing adds creaminess and tang.</p>
            <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong></li>
                <p>Hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's) turns up the heat, 
                mimicking the spicy flavor of Buffalo chicken wings.
                 Use more or less than the recipe calls 
                for to suit your flavor preferences.</p>
             <li><strong>Cheese</strong></li>
                <p>Cheddar cheese is melted into the dip,
                 creating a satisfyingly gooey texture and cheesy flavor.</p> </ul>
